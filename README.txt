PlainClothes extension for Chromium and Google Chrome
Copyright (C) 2009 Mark Pilgrim

This extension styles (or rather "unstyles") the web. Just imagine:
text is black, backgrounds are white, unread links are blue, visited
links are purple, all links are underlined. All text is rendered in
your default fonts (as defined in "Options" > "Under the Hood" >
"Change font and language settings"). Everywhere. Automatically.

You can control the extent of the "unstyling" via the Options window
("Extensions" > "PlainClothes" > "Options"), and you can toggle the
"unstyling" on a per-site basis by clicking the icon in the location
bar.

Although this is primarily designed as an accessibility feature,
anyone can use it. I use it myself, despite having no visual or
cognitive impairments.
